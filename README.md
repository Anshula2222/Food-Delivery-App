##Food-Delivery-App: UE20CS303 Project

#About the WebApp ðŸ¥˜
This is a food delivery application created using MERN stack. Throughout the project we have comprehensively implemented SCRUM principles. This app allows you to order food from different outlets that have registered with the app. Customers can save time and money by waiting in line to place an order and then picking it up later. They can browse the app's whole catalogue of food items and easily order food from any restaurant of their choice.
